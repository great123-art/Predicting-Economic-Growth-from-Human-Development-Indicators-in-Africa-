# 📈 Predicting Economic Growth from Human Development Indicators in Africa

This project explores the relationship between human capital development (education, health, labor) and economic growth (GDP) in African countries using real-world data and machine learning. We aim to build predictive models and generate actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and development agencies.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Analyze the correlation between human development indicators and economic growth.
- Build a predictive model for GDP growth based on human capital metrics.
- Identify which indicators contribute most significantly to economic performance.
- Visualize trends and disparities across countries and over time.

## 🧠 Key Technologies

- **Languages:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub, Streamlit (optional for deployment)

## 📊 Datasets

We use public datasets from:

- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/)
- [UNDP Human Development Reports](https://hdr.undp.org/data)
- [Nigeria Bureau of Statistics](https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Indicators include:
- GDP per capita
- Literacy rate
- School enrollment
- Life expectancy
- Access to clean water
- Health expenditure
- Employment rate

## 📈 Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Engineering**
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  
   - Lasso/Ridge Regression
5. **Visualization & Interpretation**
6. **(Optional)** Streamlit app for interactive exploration

## 📌 Results & Insights

- Significant positive correlations between education/health metrics and GDP growth.
- Predictive models achieve <R² score here> and <RMSE here>.
- Top contributing features include <top 3 indicators here>.
